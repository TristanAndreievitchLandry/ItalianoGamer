# ItalianoGamer : A simple game in CircuitPython to learn Italian words on the Pygamer board. It will display first the Italian flag with the anthem, then a random Italian word, then if joystick is moved to right, it will show the French translation. After 10 words, a beep sounds, then the front lights flahs the colors of the Italian flag. Note that for the sound to play from the board's speaker, you have to enable it, otherwise it will only play in headset.
